# forage
Random foraging models in Clojure.
Work in progress.
More documentation in the future.

---

There are now multiple standard build tools for Clojure.  One way to use this
project is to use Leiningen: To start a REPL in a terminal so that you
can play with the code here, install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org). Then 
*cd* into the forage directory and run *lein repl* (or use one of the scripts
in src/scripts). Leiningen's project.clj file will download and install all 
of the needed libraries *except* MASON 20 (see below). 

However, this also set up to use CLI and deps.edn.  I've tried to keep
deps.edn and project.clj in sync.

Currently, this project uses a couple of classes from MASON, a Java library for
agent-based modeling.  (However, the simulations in this project are
not agent-based at present.)  To use MASON, download mason.20.jar from
https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason .  (If you were going to use
MASON in a full-fledged manner, you'd also need some other files as well.)
Then install that jar file in your local Maven configuration so that Leiningen
can find it.  In unix systems such as MacOS, your local Maven repoistory is
probably in $HOME/.m2 .  You can use Leiningen to perform the installation if you want:
Temporarily add this line to project.clj (e.g. just before `:source-paths`).
```clojure
:plugins [[lein-localrepo "0.5.3"]]
```
Then start the repl, and run 
```clojure
lein localrepo install <jarfilepath> MASON 21
```
where `<jarfilepath>` is a string containing the full path and filename
for your mason.20.jar file.  This will copy the file to the
appropriate place under .m2, and will add an additional pom
configuration file.  After this, you can delete the above `:plugins`
line.
