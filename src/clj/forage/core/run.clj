  "Runs several foraging simulations based on inputs, writes output data
  and possibly PRNG states to files, and returns data (and the PRNG that
  was used if it was passed as an argument). Seed is only used for
  informational purposes in file output, but should be the seed for the
  PRNG that is used by the simulations. Uses parameters in the params
  map.  walk-fns should be a map with keys that are strings, and values
  that are functions of one argument, an initial location from which to
  start generated by the function. walk-fn values should return a triple
  in which the first element is a collection of one or more found
  foodspots, or nil if none were round, a path until the foodspot(s)
  were found, and the rest of the path that would have been taken if no
  foodspot(s) were found.  walk-fn values should have the same PRNG
  embedded in them; that PRNG can be passed to this function. Keys in
  walk-fns should be strings or other values that can be used as names
  of the corresponding functions for reporting purposes, and should be
  suitable for embedding in filenames. (The str function will be used to
  convert the keys to strings if they are not already strings.) Then for
  each walk-fn runs walks-per-combo food searches using the walk-fn
  (with look-fn embedded in it) for each direction in init-dirs.  seed
  is used only as an id number, e.g. in filenames.  The PRNG rng is
  never used, but its state is stored each time through the main loop,
  prior to each call to run-and-collect.  Output filenames (see below)
  are constructed using seed, values of :basename and :dirname, and in
  some cases a walk-fns key. Output:
  * Writes informational messages to stdout.
  * Writes one random number generator state file *.bin per parameter
