(println "NOTE this namespace is DEPRECATED.
         See comments immediately in file for explanation.")
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; WHY IS THIS DEPRECATED?
;; 
;; This namespace, env-matrix, was intended as a replacement for env-mason,
;; which uses MASON's Continuous2D class to represent environments.
;; I was finding that locating foodspots in Continuous2D was slow for certain
;; purposes, and I wondered whether using matrices would be more efficient.
;; 
;; The idea of env-matrix was that matrices should be represented by
;; locations in a matrix, with perceptual radii represented in the matrix
;; itself by contents of cells.  Specifically, cells could contain the
;; coordinates of a target.  The presence of those coordinates meant that
;; the location was inside the perceptual radius.  So a matrix to represent
;; a 5000x5000 environment would need to be larger by at least 100x, to
;; represent circles around targets roughly smoothly.  (Originally I wanted
;; the external interactions to use the "outer" 5000x5000 coordinates,
;; translated into the "internal"  5000000x5000000 coordinates, but that
;; was too much of a headache, so the version below requires that
;; user-level functions perform the translation inside of a look-fn.
;; 
;; Note that since what I want to encode in matrix locations is non-numeric,
;; I have three options:
;; 
;;   1. core.matrix ndarray, which is easy to work with since it allows
;;   assignment of arbitrary Clojure values into a location.  This makes it
;;   easy to initialize an environment, and easy to modify during runs
;;   (e.g. for destructive searcher).
;; 
;;   2. core.matrix persistent-vector, which is purely functional (since
;;   it's just Clojure vectors of Clojure vectors).  This means that
;;   initialization is more complicated, and modification has to be done as
;;   a functional update, which again, could be a little more difficult. In
;;   addition, would worry that indexing might be slow, but maybe that's
;;   incorrecvt.
;; 
;;   3. Encoding non-numeric information as numbers in some other kind of
;;   matrix.  Ugh.
;; 
;; The problem is that ndarray has a bug that doesn't seem to allow using
;; matrices as large as the ones I need (see
;; CoreMatrixErrorSpiral22mat.txt, and the issue I submitted
;; https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix/issues/362).
;; 
;; So I would have to rewrite env-matrix using persistent-vector, which I
;; don't relish.
;; 
;; In addition, it looks like the matrices I need are very large, and very
;; memory intensive.  That's true with ndarray, and it's likely to be at
;; least as bad with persistent-vector.
;; 
;; Finally, the original motivation was that I wanted to do runs with a
;; single target.  This meant that failure was common, so to get reasonable
;; statistics, lots and lots of runs were needed.  Hence the need for
;; speed.  However, I've now figured out that I can get equivalent results
;; using multiple targets.  So I don't need speed as much.



;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; NOTE ENV-MASON treats perceptual radius as a property of the
;; forager, so it's not represented in the env.  To get the perceptual
;; radius into the look-fn, it has to be supplied from an independent
;; source from the env.
;; By contrast, ENV-MATRIX treats perceptual radii as properties of
;; foodspots, so they are specified in the env, and look-fns have
;; to get them from the env (in effect).


;; NOTE When this was env_indexed.clj, the goal was to provide a (kind of)
;; drop-in replacement for env_mason.clj.  That meant converting between
;; external coordinates corresponding to the ones used by env-mason, and
;; internal coordinates in matrices that gave a more fined-grained resolution.
;; I decided that keeping track of the conversion between these two scales
;; was more trouble than it was worth.  So I'm instead going to just CHANGE
;; THE SCALE in new experiments that use this namespace.  Those experiments
;; will be in forage/matruns rather than forage/experiment, to distinguish
;; them.

;; NOTE FOR EXAMPLE to program an env-matrix analog of an env-mason
;; simulation with env dimensions 10K x 10K, and perc-radius = 1, an
;; env-matrix version should be at least 100X that, i.e. an env with size
;; 1M x 1M and perc-radius = 100.


;; TODO Experiment using fastmath to speed this up.
