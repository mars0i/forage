;; It can return foodspots that are too far away.


;; NOTE ENV-MASON treats perceptual radius as a property of the
;; forager, so it's not represented in the env.  To get the perceptual
;; radius into the look-fn, it has to be supplied from an independent
;; source from the env.
;; By contrast, ENV-MATRIX treats perceptual radii as properties of
;; foodspots, so they are specified in the env, and look-fns have
;; to get them from the env (in effect).
