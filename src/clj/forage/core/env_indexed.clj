;; TODO Experiment using fastmath to speed this up.

;; Note perc-foodspot fns below have different signatures from similar functions in 
;; env_mason.clj because of differences in the approach.  In env-mason,
;; perceptual radius is associated with the forager, whereas here it's 
;; built into the env, and each foodspot.

;; Todo? Nah: Maybe only place coordinates on the actual radius of the circle?
;; It doesn't really matter for initializing an env, but if I start
;; recreating targets during runs, if that happens a lot, initializing
;; rings rather than discs might be faster.
;; ON THE OTHER HAND, if a forager starts out at a random location, and I
;; use rings, the forager won't know if its inside the perceptual radius.
;; (Note that if I make rings, there's no need to have *-donut functions.)

;; Overall strategy:
;; Foodspots exist in a 2D grid made with core.matrix (or some other
;; arbitrary-content 2D structure) using one of the pure Clojure matrix implementations.
;; A foodspot is represented by a special marker (maybe true, or a number
;; representing nutritional value or an id).
;; The points around a foodspot, up to a radius in some integer-rounded 
;; coordinates, are marked with a collection containing points to the
;; foodspot it's a radius around.  This is the size of the perceptual
;; radius, but it's around the foodspots.

;; When a walk reaches a check point, mod, or better yet round its coords it to
;; get the indexes into the matrix and check whether it's in the radius
;; of the foodspot.  Since indexes are integers 0, 1, 2, ..., this could be done 
;; every sqrt(2) along the path, since that's the farthest distance between two
;; cells.  NO, it should be every 1, since that's the shortest distance
;; between two cells.
;; (Whereas with the MASON Continous2D system, I worried that one could
;; miss targets on the edge of the perc radius if you had check intervals
;; that were two large, here were are just letting the grid representation
;; decide what is close enough.  So in addition to it probably being faster
;; to look up targets this way, I don't need to check for them as often.

;; NOTE If I use regular Clojure vectors, I can use Clojure indexing:
;;   (def foo (mx/new-matrix :persistent-vector 4 4))
;;   ((foo 0) 0) ;=> 0.0
;; But I can't mset! the values, which is inconvenient: it means that I
;; have to create the entire environment at once.  If I want
;; persistent-vectors, though, I could create it as an ndarray and then
;; convert it.
