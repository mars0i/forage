This is branch **origin-in-center**.

Up until 2/16/2022, I always put the origin (0,0) in the center of the
environment.  At that point I created a new branch **origin-in-corner**
that put (0,0) in the lower left corner (because I thought it might make
toroidal display in Vega-Lite simpler).  As of 2/18 I think I'm
abandoning the toroidal display idea for now, but nevertheless I decided
to make origin-in-center my **main** branch.  *This* branch containing
the file you're reading, i.e. , **origin-in-center**, records the state
of **main** before I replaced **main** with **origin-in-corner**.
